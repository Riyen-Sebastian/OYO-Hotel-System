2.Connect to the OYO database: Enter the required credentials (username, password, and database server details) to establish a connection with the OYO database.

                                         ### Booking a Room ###

To book a room in the OYO hotel system, follow these steps:

1.View Available Hotels:
   To see a list of all available hotels, execute the following SQL query:


   SELECT * FROM Hotel;


--This will display the details of all hotels, including the hotel ID, name, address, city, state, country, zip code, and phone number.



2.View Available Rooms for a Specific Hotel:
   Once you have identified the hotel you want to stay at, execute the following SQL query to see the available rooms:


   SELECT * FROM Rooms WHERE HotelID = [HotelID] AND IsAvailable = 1;


   Replace `[HotelID]` with the ID of the hotel you selected. This query will show you all the available rooms for that hotel, along with their room ID, room type, and room rate.



3.Book a Room:
   To book a room, execute the following SQL query:

   
   UPDATE Rooms
   SET IsAvailable = 0
   WHERE RoomID = [RoomID];
   

   Replace `[RoomID]` with the ID of the room you want to book. This query will update the `IsAvailable` column for that room to `0`, marking it as booked.



4.Confirm Booking:
   To confirm your booking, execute the following SQL query:

   SELECT * FROM Rooms WHERE RoomID = [RoomID];
   

   Replace `[RoomID]` with the ID of the room you booked. This query will show you the details of the booked room, including the hotel ID, room type, and room rate.



                                    ### Canceling a Booking ###


If you need to cancel a booking, follow these steps:



1.Find the Booked Room:
   Execute the following SQL query to retrieve the details of your booked room:


   SELECT * FROM Rooms WHERE IsAvailable = 0 AND HotelID = [HotelID];


   Replace `[HotelID]` with the ID of the hotel where you booked the room. This query will show you all the booked rooms for that hotel.



2.Cancel the Booking:
   To cancel your booking, execute the following SQL query:

   

   UPDATE Rooms
   SET IsAvailable = 1
   WHERE RoomID = [RoomID];
   

   Replace `[RoomID]` with the ID of the room you want to cancel. This query will update the `IsAvailable` column for that room to `1`, marking it as available again.

3.Confirm Cancellation:
   To confirm the cancellation, execute the following SQL query:


   SELECT * FROM Rooms WHERE RoomID = [RoomID];


   Replace `[RoomID]` with the ID of the room you canceled. This query will show you the details of the room, and the `IsAvailable` column should now be `1`.

Remember to replace the placeholders (`[HotelID]`, `[RoomID]`, etc.) with the appropriate values based on your booking details.
